Full-Stack web app to help users track workouts and caloric goals

- Led a group of 4 engineers to develop a full-stack web app to assist users with tracking their workouts and caloric goals.
- Created relational schemas and ER/UML diagrams to design the back-end of the database.
- Implemented basic CRUD operations in the back-end where users can update their calorie count and build their desired
  workout schedule.
